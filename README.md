# Personal Website
This is my personal website, which discusses my projects and experiences, as well as some other fun things.
<br>
The HTML and CSS were coded and designed by me, while the JS scripts are partially my doing and partially forked from other websites that had cool interaction features. You can call it a "FrankenSite" as a result, if you will.
