<h2 id="on-this-site">MLIS Core Classes:</h2>
<p><strong>LIS 520, Principles of Library and Information Science</strong> (Autumn 2022)</p>
<p>This core class was a broad introduction to the practical skills necessary for providing quality information services. We practiced completing web, database, and library discovery system searches, and analyzed results. Lessons also covered the proper techniques for successfully responding to reference queries to prevent negative closure, and the importance of cultivating relationships across the patron base, conducting periodic community needs assessments, and modern-day commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="520-Presentation.pdf">CS Research Database Evaluation</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This was a group presentation where we evaluated three databases -- Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the ACM Digital Library -- for their effectiveness for research in computer science, and gave recommendations to potential users.</li>  
      <li>In all honesty, this assignment was a trainwreck. We were randomly assigned CS as the subject by our instructor, even though none of us selected it as our top choice and nobody in our group had a CS background (we were all humanities/social science undergraduates). It took a lot of extra time and multiple search attempts to come to a conclusion, and I think this is a good example of our collective ability to overcome adversity.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="520-Final.pdf">Reference Consultation: AI in the Stock Market</a></li>
   <ul>
      <li>This was the first time I completed reference work, interviewing my father on his hobby in the stock market. I was able to use the skills I gained throughout this class -- asking relevant questions to help dissect a problem, searching for relevant articles on databases, and refining my search using different filters and operators -- to provide satisfying results to my user. I thought that I was able to apply class concepts well but could have improved the way I asked open-ended questions, which is a fundamental skill for libraries.</li> 
   </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIS 530, Organization of Information Resources</strong> (Winter 2023)</p>
<p>This core class provided me with an overview of the more theoretical foundations of library and information science, particularly knowledge organization -- how we describe, classify, and manage the contents of information systems. The central focus of the class was familiarizing students with the conceptual frameworks and working principles underpinning major knowledge organization systems, like catalogs, taxonomies, and databases. Topics included theoretical and practical foundations of classification systems, the uses of unique identifiers, controlled vocabularies, and subject headings, and the connections between traditional catalog-based indexing and contemporary web searches and tagging functions.</li>
