<h2 id="on-this-site">MLIS Core Classes:</h2>
<p><strong>LIS 520, Principles of Library and Information Science</strong> (Autumn 2022)</p>
<p>This class was a broad introduction to the foundations of librarianship and the skills necessary for providing quality information services. We practiced completing web and library database searches, and learned the importance of cultivating relationships across the patron base and commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion in libraries.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="520-Presentation.pdf">CS Research Database Evaluation</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This was a group presentation where we evaluated three databases -- Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the ACM Digital Library -- for their effectiveness for research in computer science, and gave recommendations to potential users.</li>  
      <li>In all honesty, this assignment was a trainwreck. We were randomly assigned CS as the subject by our instructor, even though none of us selected it as our top choice and nobody in our group had a CS background (we were all humanities/social science undergraduates). It took a lot of extra time and multiple search attempts to come to a conclusion, and I think this is a good example of our collective ability to overcome adversity.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="520-Final.pdf">Reference Consultation: AI in the Stock Market</a></li>
   <ul>
      <li>This was the first time I completed reference work, interviewing my father on his hobby in the stock market. I was able to use the skills I gained throughout this class -- asking relevant questions to help dissect a problem, searching for relevant articles on databases, and refining my search using different filters and operators -- to provide satisfying results to my user. I thought that I was able to apply class concepts well but could have improved the way I asked open-ended questions, which is a fundamental skill for libraries.</li> 
   </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIS 530, Organization of Information Resources</strong> (Winter 2023)</p>
<p>This class provided me with an overview of the theoretical foundations of library and information science, particularly how we describe, classify, and manage the contents of information systems (<em>knowledge organization</em>). The central focus of the class was familiarizing students with the conceptual frameworks and working principles underpinning knowledge organization systems, like catalogs, controlled vocabularies/taxonomies, and databases.</li>
<ul>
  <li><a href="530-Abstracts.pdf">Reading Responses: Abstracts</a></li>
   <ul>
     <li>This is a collection of the ten reading responses I did over the quarter, in the style of abstracts, and subject headings I would choose to assign to the readings. This was a good exercise in not only selecting the most important parts of a reading to communicate to others, but in communicating concisely.</li>
   </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="530-Wayback.pdf">"Water" Over Time on Wikipedia</a></li>
   <ul>
     <li>This was a writing assignment, or "quest," as my professor called it, where I looked at the way subject categories used to classify "water" changed over time on Wikipedia. From this assignment, I gained a better understanding of the subjective nature of "objectivity" in subject classification, and its effects on knowledge organization.</li>
   </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ChessPiece21/LIS-530-Labs">Class Labs: Reference Management Systems</a></li>
   <ul>
     <li>These were five "labs" we did over the class, that taught us how to use <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> and the <a href="http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTeX</a> indexing languages for reference management. While I enjoyed the theoretical portions of the class, I appreciated gaining this practical knowledge too.</li>
   </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="530-Final.pdf">Final Project: Hierarchical Index of Rapper Names</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIS 547, Design Methods</strong> (Winter 2023)</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="547-GPT.pdf">Instructional Design with ChatGPT</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://joelollo.medium.com/re-balancing-catan-with-value-sensitive-design-de28634a9c9f">Re-Balancing Catan</a></li>
  <li><a href="baloney-detectives.html">Final Project: <em>Baloney Detectives</em></a> -- Virtual Escape Room</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIS 570, Research Design</strong> (Autumn 2022)</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="570-Final.pdf">Community-Engaged Research Proposal: Zine Workshops in Academic Libraries</a></li>
</ul>
