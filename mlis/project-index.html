<h2 id="on-this-site">MLIS Core Classes:</h2>
<p><strong>LIS 520, Principles of Library and Information Science</strong> (Autumn 2022)</p>
<p>This class was a broad introduction to the foundations of librarianship and the skills necessary for providing quality information services. We practiced completing web and library database searches, and learned the importance of cultivating relationships across the patron base and commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion in libraries.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="520-Presentation.pdf">CS Research Database Evaluation</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This was a group presentation where we evaluated three databases -- Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the ACM Digital Library -- for their effectiveness for research in computer science, and gave recommendations to potential users.</li>  
      <li>In all honesty, this assignment was a trainwreck. We were randomly assigned CS as the subject by our instructor, even though none of us selected it as our top choice and nobody in our group had a CS background (we were all humanities/social science undergraduates). It took a lot of extra time and multiple search attempts to come to a conclusion, and I think this is a good example of our collective ability to overcome adversity.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="520-Final.pdf">Reference Consultation: AI in the Stock Market</a></li>
   <ul>
      <li>This was the first time I completed reference work, interviewing my father on his hobby in the stock market. I was able to use the skills I gained throughout this class -- asking relevant questions to help dissect a problem, searching for relevant articles on databases, and refining my search using different filters and operators -- to provide satisfying results to my user. I thought that I was able to apply class concepts well but could have improved the way I asked open-ended questions, which is a fundamental skill for libraries.</li> 
   </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIS 530, Organization of Information Resources</strong> (Winter 2023)</p>
<p>This class provided me with an overview of the theoretical foundations of library and information science, particularly how we describe, classify, and manage the contents of information systems (<em>knowledge organization</em>). The central focus of the class was familiarizing students with the conceptual frameworks and working principles underpinning knowledge organization systems, like catalogs, controlled vocabularies/taxonomies, and databases.</li>
<ul>
  <li><a href="530-Abstracts.pdf">Reading Responses: Abstracts</a></li>
   <ul>
     <li>This is a collection of the ten reading responses I did over the quarter, in the style of abstracts, and subject headings I would choose to assign to the readings. This was a good exercise in not only selecting the most important parts of a reading to communicate to others, but in communicating concisely.</li>
   </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="530-Wayback.pdf">"Water" Over Time on Wikipedia</a></li>
   <ul>
     <li>This was a writing assignment, or "quest," as my professor called it, where I looked at the way subject categories used to classify "water" changed over time on Wikipedia. From this assignment, I gained a better understanding of the subjective nature of "objectivity" in subject classification, and its effects on knowledge organization.</li>
   </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ChessPiece21/LIS-530-Labs">Class Labs: Reference Management Systems</a></li>
   <ul>
     <li>These were five "labs" we did over the class, that taught us how to use <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> and the <a href="http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTeX</a> indexing languages for reference management. While I enjoyed the theoretical portions of the class, I appreciated gaining this practical knowledge too.</li>
   </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="530-Final.pdf">Final Project: Hierarchical Index of Rapper Names</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This was the final project in our class, where we applied hierarchical classification and taxonomic thinking to a concept of our choice, and visualized the taxonomy in the way I wrote it. I had a great time working on this taxonomy, as many rapper names fall under several large categories and it was fun to index them in broader and specific terms.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIS 547, Design Methods</strong> (Winter 2023)</p>
<p>This class taught me about "design thinking" and the way it applies to information settings, including strategies for user research and user-centered desing thinking, problem-framing, ideation, and prototyping.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://joelollo.medium.com/re-balancing-catan-with-value-sensitive-design-de28634a9c9f">Experiment 1: Re-Balancing <em>Catan</em></a></li>
    <ul>
       <li>This was an exploration of systems design and analysis that I made into a blog post on my instructor's recommendation. In it, I discuss some issues that potential stakeholders have with the board game <em>Catan</em> and use systems analysis concepts to re-format the game in a way that makes it more enjoyable.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="547-GPT.pdf">Experiment 2: Instructional Design with ChatGPT</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This was the inevitable approach to using ChatGPT, a popular generative AI chatbot, that we had the option to do as a design project in this class. I discussed the possibility of having AI design lesson plans aimed at higher education students, and evaluated and reflected on the results that ChatGPT gave me. This helped me see both the strengths and potential pitfalls that designing with the assistance, or usage, of AI has.</li> 
    </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="baloney-detectives.html">Design Project: <em>Baloney Detectives</em></a> -- Virtual Escape Room</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIS 570, Research Design</strong> (Autumn 2022)</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="570-Final.pdf">Community-Engaged Research Proposal: Zine Workshops in Academic Libraries</a></li>
   <ul>
     <li>This was my final written assignment for this class, where I proposed an IMLS <a href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/available/community-catalyst-initiative">Community Catalyst Initiative</a> (CCI) research grant that aimed to develop students' multimodal literacy in the UW Libraries through zine-making workshops. I discuss the theoretical foundations of zines and how they are used in (sub-)cultural development and community engagement outside of libraries, and propose a three-year plan for the co-design of these workshops alongside students and faculty.</li>
     <li>This assignment was my first "big" written assignment in the MLIS program, and I believe that through it I got great preparation for future research that I see myself doing as I aspire to work in similar settings.</li>
   </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIS 572, Introduction to Data Science</strong> (Autumn 2022)</p>
<p>As my choice for the Information Technology Core course, this class gave me a good introduction on how to code in R and perform mixed-methods research using data-driven skills alongside more qualitative analysis. I appreciated how open-ended the assignments are and the applications they had to digital humanities and library science, and I believe I have a strong command of data analysis and visualization from the class.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ChessPiece21/LIS-572">Class GitHub Repository</a></li>
   <ul>
     <li>This is the repository on GitHub where all my assignments for this class are stored, cloned from my instructor's own repository. It includes all weekly coding exercises, the midterm, and a link to the final.</li>
   </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://joelollo.medium.com/cheers-love-the-analysts-here-using-data-science-methods-to-assess-overwatch-2-play-rates-c996e3ceb065">Final Project: <em>Overwatch 2</em> Play Rate Data Analysis</a></li>
   <ul>
     <li>In my final project for this class, I used Medium to visualize data and analyze trends in player choice with specific characters during the first three months of the first-person shooting game <em>Overwatch 2</em>'s release, and close-reading the data visualization by connecting them to cultural factors and some specific readings from the class.</li>
     <li>You can also view the <a href="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~JoeLollo21">interactive visualizations for this blog post</a> by themselves on Plotly.</li>
   </ul>

<h2 id="on-this-site">MLIS Electives:</h2>
<p><strong>LIS 545, Data Curation I</strong> (Winter 2023)</p> 
<p>This class taught me about the way that data is managed, documented, and preserved in various settings. We received a breakdown of basic data types (string, integer, Boolean, etc.), tools and standards for data management (including GitHub!), and an introduction to XML basics (such as syntax, attributes, and nodes) for metadata design.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ChessPiece21/LIS-54X/tree/main/Exercises/Metadata-Comparison">Comparing Metadata Standards</a></li>
   <ul>
     <li>In this assignment, I compare two metadata schemas to describe a dataset, namely Dublin Core and DataCite. I analyze both schemas using the FAIR data principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, readability) and make a recommendation with the intended audience in mind.</li>
   </ul>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ChessPiece21/LIS-54X/tree/main/Dataset-Profile">Midterm Project: <em>The Pudding</em> Dataset Profile</a></li>
   <ul>
     <li>This was my midterm group project for this class. My awesome friend and project partner Giselle (Gigi) Shannon and I made recommendations for the long-term management of the data used in <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/04/kidz-bop/">"Just How Does Kidz Bop Censor Songs?" from <em>The Pudding</em></a>, and created documentation in the form of a data dictionary.</li>
   </ul>
