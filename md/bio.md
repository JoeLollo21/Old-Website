# Hi, I'm Joe Lollo.
I am a graduate student in the Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program at the University of Washington.
<br><br>
I am passionate about the digital humanities, and particularly using computational and open-source methods in DH scholarship and pedagogy. It is my hope that I can teach and research in this field as a career, after finishing graduate school.
<br><br>
In 2022, I graduated with a B.A. in English Literature (with Honors) and Media Studies from UW Bothell. My Honors thesis, *The (Non-)Fantastical Subject: Narrative Authority as Resistance in Magical Realism*, was advised by [Dr. Raissa DeSmet](https://www.uwb.edu/ias/faculty-and-staff/raissa-desmet).
<br><br>
In my spare time, I enjoy playing and listening to music, reading, gaming, watching movies, and making memes.
