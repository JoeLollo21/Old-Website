# Hi, I'm Joe Lollo.
I am a graduate student in the Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program and [Certificate in Digital Humanities](https://txtds.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington.
<br>
I am passionate about digital humanities scholarship and education, instructional design, and information access.
<br>
Presently, I'm working as an Instructional Design and Outreach Specialist with the UW Libraries' Office of Learning Services, using my skills in communication, education, and design to promote, host, and evaluate educational workshops.
<br>
In 2022, I graduated with a B.A. in English Literature (with Honors) and Media Studies UW Bothell's [School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences](https://www.uwb.edu/ias). My Honors thesis at UWB, *The (Non-)Fantastical Subject: Narrative Authority as Resistance in Magical Realism*, was advised by [Dr. Raissa DeSmet](https://www.uwb.edu/ias/faculty-and-staff/raissa-desmet).
